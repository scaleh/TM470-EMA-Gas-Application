    <h1>Welcome to the GAS Application</h1>
    <div>
        <p>The Green Assessment and Screening or GAS application is designed for users who work with hazardous materials and chemicals. The application is able to show the
            material safety datasheet by either searching by inputting text, selecting or scanning the bar code of the hazardous material or chemical. From this, the user can
            use this information to perform a risk assessment of the work area or activity and therefore, ensure the health and safety for all participants. Additionally, the
            application is able to show the user on an interactive map where the nearest Personal Protective Equipment provider is based and also where local medical
            facilities are, in case of emergencies.</p>
        <p><b>Disclaimer.</b> Only trained personal are allowed to handle hazardous material when an adequate risk assessment has been performed in accordance with the COSHH
            Regulations 2002 (in the United Kingdom) and any other similar regulations world wide. Please also note that the MSDS content within the application remains
            the property of the manufacturer. Please contact the manufacturer directly for any safety concerns with any of the hazardous material noted. All locations of
            are correct as of September 2020.</p>
